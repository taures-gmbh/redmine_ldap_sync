    # in UTF-8 and therefore the only thing to be done when instantiating is to
    # switch the encoding from 'ASCII-8BIT' to 'UTF-8'.
    #
    # Unfortunately, there are some ActiveDirectory specific attributes
    # (like `objectguid`) that should remain binary (do they really?).
    # Using the `#valid_encoding?` we can trap this cases. Special cases like
    # Japanese, Korean, etc. encodings might also profit from this. However
    # I have no clue how this encodings function.
